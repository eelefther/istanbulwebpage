            <p>
                Rumelihisarı (also known as Rumelian Castle and Roumeli Hissar Castle) is a fortress located in the Sariyer district of Istanbul, Turkey, on a hill at the European side of the Bosphorus. It gives the name of the quarter around it. It was built by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II between 1451 and 1452, before he conquered Constantinople. The three great towers were named after three of Mehmed II's viziers, Sadrazam Candarlı Halil Pasha, who built the big tower next to the gate, Zaganos Pasha, who built the south tower, and Sarica Pasha, who built the north tower. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It also has three main gates next to the three main towers. The big tower is in the north, the south tower is in the south, and the north tower is in the east. The fortress has 13 small watchtowers placed on the walls. Inside the fortress, there are 13 cisterns, a small mosque, and several houses. These cisterns were built to store rainwater, which was later used by the soldiers stationed at the fortress. The fortress was used to control the sea traffic on the Bosphorus and to prevent aid from the Black Sea reaching Constantinople during the Turkish siege of the city in 1453.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fortress was declared a museum in 1960 and opened to the public in 1961. It is open to the public every day except Wednesdays. The fortress is located in the Sariyer district of Istanbul, Turkey, on a hill at the European side of the Bosphorus. It gives the name of the quarter around it.
