            <h1>Basilica Cistern</h1>

            <p>
                Basilica Cistern, is the largest of several hundred ancient cisterns that lie beneath the city of Istanbul, Turkey. The cistern, located 150 metres (490 ft) southwest of the Hagia Sophia on the historical peninsula of Sarayburnu, was built in the 6th century during the reign of Byzantine emperor Justinian I. Today it is kept with little water, for public access inside the space.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cistern is surrounded by a firebrick wall with a thickness of 4 metres (13 ft) and is coated with a waterproofing mortar. The cistern's water was provided from the Belgrade Forest, which lies 19 kilometres (12 mi) north of the city. This forest was once the favourite Imperial hunting grounds of the Byzantine emperors. The cistern has the capacity to store 100,000 tons of water, despite being virtually empty today with only a few feet of water lining the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cistern, located beneath the Stoa Basilica, was enlarged during the reign of Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century. The enlarged cistern provided a water filtration system for the Great Palace of Constantinople and other buildings on the First Hill, and continued to provide water to the Topkapi Palace after the Ottoman conquest in 1453 and into modern times.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cistern was used as a location for the 1963 James Bond film From Russia with Love. In the film, it is referred to as being constructed by the Emperor Constantine, with no reference to Justinian. The cistern is open daily to the public and has a walkway over the water where visitors can walk and view the cistern.
