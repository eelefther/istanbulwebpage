                The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is one of the largest and oldest covered markets in the world, with 61 covered streets and over 4,000 shops which attract between 250,000 and 400,000 visitors daily. In 2014, it was listed No.1 among the world's most-visited tourist attractions with 91,250,000 annual visitors. The Grand Bazaar at Istanbul is often regarded as one of the first shopping malls of the world.

                The construction of the future Grand Bazaar's core started during the winter of 1455/56, shortly after the Ottoman conquest of

                Constantinople. Sultan Mehmet II had an edifice erected devoted to the trading of textiles. It was named Cevâhir Bedestan ("Bedesten of Gems") and was also known as Bezzâzistan-ı Cedîd ("New Bedesten") in Ottoman Turkish. The word bedesten is adapted from the Persian word bezestan, derived from bez ("cloth"), and means "bazaar of the cloth sellers". The building – named alternately in Turkish İç (Internal) Bedesten – lies on the slope of the third hill of Istanbul, between the ancient Fora of Constantine and the mosque of Beyazit Pasha. It was also near the first sultan's palace, the Old Palace (Eski Saray).

                Grand Bazaar opened in 1461. Over time, it has expanded to include other surrounding buildings. The Grand Bazaar remained the commercial center of the city until the mid-19th century, when the city's rapidly expanding European population began turning to other districts, such as Galata and Pera, to shop, and by the early 20th century, the Grand Bazaar had fallen into disrepair. In 1894, a fatwa decreeing the market as a charitable foundation was declared. The Grand Bazaar was vastly renovated in the beginning of the 20th century. Two of the most important events in the history of the bazaar were the fire of 1954, which destroyed the inner bazaar completely, and the fire of 1964, which destroyed the outer bazaar partially.
